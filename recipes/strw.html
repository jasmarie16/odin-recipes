    <p>This Homemade Strawberry Ice Cream is creamy, dreamy, and made with fresh strawberries. Itâ€™s an old fashioned strawberry ice cream recipe that makes it the perfect spring or summer dessert.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>1 1/2 cups strawberries</strong>, hulled and diced</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp <strong>honey</strong></li>
        <li> 1/2 cup granulated <strong>sugar</strong></li>
        <li>1 tsp <strong>lemon juice</strong></li>
        <li>1 cup <strong>heavy whipping cream</strong></li>
        <li>1/2 cup <strong>half and half</strong></li>
        <li>1 tsp <strong>vanilla extract</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <h2>How to Make Strawberry Ice Cream</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, <strong>mix</strong> strawberries, honey, sugar, and lemon juice. <strong>Allow to sit</strong> 15-20 minutes, or until the strawberries have released their juices.</li>
        <li><strong>Mash</strong> the mixture with a potato masher, fork, or pastry cutter until there are no longer any large strawberry pieces (if you prefer a smooth ice cream, use a blender or food processor instead*).</li>
        <li>To the strawberries, <strong>mix</strong> heavy cream, half and half, and vanilla extract. Stir just until combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Pour the mixture</strong> into your ice cream maker, and follow your manufacturer's instructions (mine took about 15-20 minutes to churn). You can eat the ice cream soft-serve, or freeze it in an airtight container for 3-4 hours to thicken it up slightly. For best results, allow the ice cream to sit at room temperature for about 5-10 minutes to soften before serving.</li>
    </ol>
