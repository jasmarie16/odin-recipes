    <h5>Finished Flan.</h5>
    <p>Original recipe <a href="https://natashaskitchen.com/flan-recipe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> here.</a></p>
    <p>This Flan recipe has a sweet and creamy custard center with a golden crown of caramel that pours over the cake as you slide off the pan. This is a make-ahead dessert (it requires some chilling in the refrigerator), which makes it perfect for parties and holidays like Cinco de Mayo! </p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Condensed milk</strong> – adds sweetness to the flan. For a more authentic dessert, we recommend using La Lechera brand.
            <li><strong>Heavy whipping cream</strong> – creates a creamy and indulgent custard base.</li>
            <li><strong>Vanilla extract</strong> – use a generous amount to add layers of vanilla flavor. We used our homemade Vanilla extract. A high-quality Mexican vanilla can be substituted for a more authentic flan recipe.</li>
            <li><strong>Eggs</strong> – allow the custard to thicken and set properly.</li> 
            <li><strong>Salt</strong> – balances the sweetness and rounds out all of the flavors. </li>
        </ul>
    <h2>How to Make Flan</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Prep</strong> – Because the caramel sets quickly, you want to have a 9″ x 2″ round cake pan out and ready for use. Also, preheat the oven to 350˚F and bring a kettle of water to boil.</li>
            <li><strong>Make the Caramel</strong> – In a saucepan, combine water and sugar and bring to a boil then reduce the heat to a simmer. As soon as it starts to change color, start swirling the pan. Once it’s the color of cinnamon, take it off the heat and swirl it for another 30 seconds.</li>
            <li><strong>Pour melted sugar</strong> into your cake pan and immediately tilt the pan to coat the bottom (be careful the pan will get hot!).</li>
            <li><strong>Make the Custard</strong> – Combine the custard ingredients in a blender and blend on low speed for 1 minute. Strain through a sieve lined with cheesecloth (to reduce the bubbles) and pour over your caramel layer.</li>
            <li><strong>Cover</strong> the cake pan with foil and set the pan inside of a large roasting pan then set the roasting pan in your oven. Pour hot water into the roasting pan, about halfway up the sides of the cake pan.</li>
            <li><strong>Bake at 350</strong> for 70-80 minutes or until there is just a slight jiggle in the center. Remove from oven, uncover, transfer to a rack, and cool to room temperature then cover and refrigerate for at least 6 hours or overnight.</li>
            <li><strong>To Serve</strong> – Run a knife around the edges of the cake pan. Set the cake on a rimmed platter and invert the cake onto the platter. Tap the cake pan until you feel it dislodging then lift the cake pan off the cake.</li>        
        </ol>
    <h2>Variations</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Cinnamon</strong> – add 2 teaspoons of cinnamon to the cream mixture and blend it into the mixture. </li>
            <li><strong>Mangos</strong> - top the flan with sliced mangos as we did in our Mango Cake. Mangos are a popular variation in the Philippines. </li>
        </ul>
